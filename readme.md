# Advanced SQL Puzzles
### Welcome to the GitHub repository. Here you will find numerous SQL puzzles to test your level of SQL knowledge. I hope you enjoy solving these puzzles.

All solutions are written in SQL Server T-SQL, but can be easily modified to fit your flavor of SQL.

I also have quite a few tips, tricks and learning materials available if you scroll through. I try to keep things to the advanced level and not recreate the already abundant amount of SQL resource materials available.
